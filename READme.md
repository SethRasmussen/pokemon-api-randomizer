# The Project #

The PokeApi Team Builder is a small application designed to give the user a random pokemon (taken from the PokeAPI) based on a determined type and generation the user sets.  

# How to Use #

To use the PokeAPI team builder just go to the URL [Link](https://pokeapi-team-builder.herokuapp.com/) ||  https://pokeapi-team-builder.herokuapp.com/

The primary features of the application and how to use them are as such:

To utilize the Randomizer you need to select a Type of Pokemon and Generation/Region you would like the pokemon to be from. 
You then use the shuffle button to receive a random pokemon from those two parameters. You can either add the Pokemon to your team or shuffle again with the same or new parametes. 
Once a pokemon is added to your team you can view some basic stats about the pokemon as well as remove any pokemon you no longer want with the remove button.
